  Analyze the performance implications of these changes:

  1. **Algorithm Complexity**
     - Time complexity (Big O)
     - Space complexity
     - Nested loops and recursion depth

  2. **Database Performance**
     - Query optimization (missing indexes, N+1 queries)
     - Connection pooling
     - Caching opportunities

  3. **Memory Management**
     - Memory leaks
     - Large object allocations
     - Garbage collection pressure

  4. **Network Optimization**
     - API call batching
     - Payload size reduction
     - Compression opportunities

  5. **Frontend Performance**
     - Render blocking resources
     - Bundle size impact
     - React re-render optimization

  For each issue found:
  - **Impact**: Quantify performance impact
  - **Location**: Specific code location
  - **Optimization**: Concrete improvement suggestion
  - **Trade-offs**: Any downsides to consider
