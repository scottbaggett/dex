  Evaluate the test quality and coverage:

  1. **Test Coverage**
     - All code paths tested
     - Edge cases covered
     - Error conditions handled
     - Boundary value testing

  2. **Test Quality**
     - Tests are isolated (no dependencies)
     - Fast execution time
     - Deterministic (no flaky tests)
     - Clear test names and structure

  3. **Test Types**
     - Unit tests for business logic
     - Integration tests for workflows
     - E2E tests for critical paths
     - Performance tests where needed

  4. **Mocking & Stubbing**
     - Appropriate use of mocks
     - Not over-mocked
     - Test doubles are realistic

  5. **Assertions**
     - Specific and meaningful
     - Test one thing per test
     - Good failure messages

  - **Missing Tests**: What scenarios need coverage
  - **Test Improvements**: How to make tests better
  - **Coverage Gaps**: Uncovered code paths
  - **Best Practices**: Testing patterns to adopt
