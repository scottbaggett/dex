# Task 07: Add MIT LICENSE File

## Problem
Package.json declares MIT license but no LICENSE file exists in the repository.

## Current State
- package.json line 19: `"license": "MIT"`
- No LICENSE file in root directory
- Legal ambiguity for users and contributors

## Requirements
- Standard MIT LICENSE file
- Copyright holder information
- Year of creation
- Proper formatting

## Implementation Plan
1. Create standard MIT LICENSE file
2. Add copyright holder name
3. Include correct year
4. Verify GitHub recognizes license
5. Update README to reference license

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] LICENSE file exists in root
- [ ] Contains standard MIT license text
- [ ] Copyright holder identified
- [ ] Current year included
- [ ] GitHub shows license in repo header
- [ ] README references license

## License Content
```
